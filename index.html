									<h2>Introduction</h2>
								</header>
									<p>
									
									The global Coronavirus pandemic has had a major impact over everyone’s lives, things we took for granted like our socialization norms, methods of communication, even the way we inhabit common spaces has been completely uprooted by current events.
									In this climate, we see a lot of attempts at going back to “normality”; with many software solutions aiming to bridge the gap between how people used to experience their lives before, and how they experience them now. Video conference apps, virtual meeting spaces, and virtual queuing platforms try to create environments that mimic old norms; this assumes that the problems we’re facing are temporary, and are aiming to minimize their impact in the meantime. Our project aims to create a system that will allow people to socialize in a manner that’s much closer to how we naturally interact, while also providing suppliers of common spaces control over who goes in or out.
									The project is a Common Spaces Tracking System (CSTS), it will allow locations like University Campuses and Public Libraries to still provide the public with access to common spaces to interact and work, while maintaining appropriate precautions and safety protocol. There are many resources around us that are being under-utlized because of the pandemic, our system aims to establish a preemptive safeguard against future social distancing guidelines. By giving companies and public spaces control over who goes in and tracking data over past visits, we can continue to make more efficient and safer use of our public spaces while maintaining public safety. Our end goal is to create an abstract common space management system that can be easily implemented by any organization with minimal overhead and cost.

									<h2>Goals </h2> </header>
									<p>
									Making use of existing indoor common spaces while adhering to COVID-19 social distancing guidelines</p>
									<p>Provide an easy to use application to navigate available common spaces.</p>
									<p>Provide clients with the ability to keep track of current occupants and capacity of all their common spaces</p>
									<p>Provide students with information as to which spaces are full </p>
									<p>Provide clients with historical data for who has been in a common place at any specific time</p>
									<p>Provide clients the functionality to add and remove people from provided common spaces </p>
									<p>Provide client with the ability to flag certain people as potentially dangerous or confirmed COVID case</p>
								</p>
									<header>
										<h2>Socio-economic impact
										</h2> </header>	
										<p>
								
									Currently, there are a lot of physical resources and spaces not being used due to the danger of spreading COVID, these infrastructures took a long time and large sums of money to develop, but they currently lie useless. In fact, many physical resources serve only to drain funds for things like always-on lighting, maintenance and cleaning. Our system would allow companies to dampen the economic impact of this or any future pandemic, by minimizing the resources that go to waste. In addition, it would reproduce many of the jobs that were initially lost when common spaces were closed off. Potentially, the careful reopening of common spaces might warrant similar reopenings of some indoor restaurants, vending machines and other services. It is important to note that there are many benefits to meeting in person as opposed to video calls, our system will hopefully allow us to tap into some of these benefits while mitigating or neutralizing the losses we would incur from in person meetings. In addition, as social creatures human beings need some amount of in-person interaction, creating avenues for people to meet up safely will have a positive impact on both mental health and work performance.

										<h2>User Story
										</h2> </header>	
										
										<p>
									StoryName: Client signs in user to common space
									Description:
									As an employer
									
									I need to add a person to a specific common space
									
									So that I have control over common space occupancy.
									
									Acceptance criteria:
									As a client, can I add/remove people from available spaces?
									As a client, can I check any common space’s capacity?
									Aa client, can I check a specific common space’s history?
									Can users check availability of common spaces?
								</p>
									<header>
										<h2>Comparison with existing system
										</h2> </header>	
									<p>
									To our knowledge and after conducting appropriate research, there are no existing tools that aim to accomplish the same thing as our project. Many locations naturally have their own in-house monitoring system that informs them of the capacities of the different spaces they offer and allow them to place people inside, but those were all created specifically for select spaces; a library’s study rooms, a gym’s basketball courts etc. Our goal is to create an abstract system that can be applied to any location, regardless of whether or not they have specific “rentable” common spaces. It aims to give them the ability to section off larger spaces into smaller ones with different capacities, essentially allowing any company or entity to turn their unusable spaces into more manageable, trackable chunks. The physical separation and proper sectioning off is the responsibility of the client, as the system will assume that each space is isolated from the other.
